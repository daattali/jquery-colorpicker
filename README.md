v1.6

This is a jQuery plugin that creates a colour picker from an input field. It is a fork of [another plugin](https://github.com/claviska/jquery-minicolors) with many modifications made to make it more suited to integrate with [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) and to add some useful features.

## Modifications by Dean Attali:  

- Added "limited" palette that allows the user to specify their only a set of allowed colour rather than any colour
- Added "allowTransparent" setting which allows users to check a checkbox to select the colour "transparent"
- Added "showColour" setting which determines if to show the selected colour as the text, as the background colour of the input field, or both
- Added "returnName" setting which makes the widget return a name instead of HEX value when possible
- Added "closeOnClick" settings which closes the selection panel after a colour has been selected
- Removed many unnecessary features 
- Removed dependency on images and made the colour picker completely CSS

## Additional modifications by David Griswold:

- Added "allowAlpha" option that allows the user to select colours with an alpha transparency channel
- Made inputs more flexible by allowing colours to be entered as names or as hex, rgb, rgba, hsl, or hsla strings

This plugin works for IE8+, Chrome, Firefox, mobile, and should work for all other major browsers.

Modified plugin is being used in [colourpicker](https://github.com/daattali/colourpicker/) - an R package providing colour pickers for Shiny apps.

The [`index.html`](./index.html) page contains very basic examples of how to use this plugin.
